## Bank Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering and Streamlit

This project aims to predict customer clusters for enhanced bank profitability through targeted customer engagement. It utilizes Apache Spark (PySpark) to analyze a large dataset of over 1 million customers and leverages various techniques for effective customer segmentation and prediction.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Comprehensive cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier detection for data quality.
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and identify patterns.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Implementation of the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model for improved customer segmentation.
* **Clustering:**
    * Development and evaluation of a K-means clustering model using the elbow method and silhouette score.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:**
    * Integration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance model efficiency.
* **Classification:**
    * Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm on the clustered data, achieving an F1 score of 98% for accurate cluster prediction of new customers.
* **Web Application:**
    * Streamlit web application built to predict customer clusters for new entries, facilitating real-time insights.

**Project Benefits:**

* **Enhanced Customer Segmentation:** Enables targeted marketing campaigns and product recommendations based on customer clusters.
* **Improved Bank Profitability:** Leads to increased customer engagement and potential revenue growth.
* **Scalability and Efficiency:** Utilizes Apache Spark for handling large datasets efficiently.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Streamlit app provides user-friendly cluster prediction for new customers.

**Future Enhancements:**

* Explore alternative clustering algorithms for potential performance improvements.
* Integrate machine learning models for personalized product recommendations.
* Deploy the web application for real-world use within the bank.

This project showcases a comprehensive approach to customer segmentation using K-means clustering and provides valuable insights for targeted customer engagement strategies.
