# Bank Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering and Streamlit: A Comprehensive Approach for Targeted Engagement

This project delves into the realm of customer segmentation within the banking industry, aiming to predict customer clusters and subsequently enhance bank profitability through targeted customer engagement strategies. Utilizing Apache Spark (PySpark) for efficient large-scale data analysis, the project employs various techniques to achieve effective customer segmentation and predictive capabilities.

### Motivation and Business Objective:

In today's competitive banking landscape, understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial for maximizing profitability. This project addresses this challenge by developing a data-driven approach to customer segmentation. By identifying distinct customer clusters based on their banking activities, the project empowers banks to tailor their marketing strategies, product recommendations, and overall customer engagement efforts for each segment. This targeted approach fosters stronger customer relationships, leading to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, enhanced bank profitability.

### Data Analysis and Preprocessing:

The project leverages a substantial dataset exceeding 1 million customer records. To ensure the data's quality and reliability for subsequent analysis, a meticulous data cleaning process is undertaken. This process involves handling missing values, identifying and addressing outliers, and employing various techniques to ensure data integrity. Furthermore, comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, spending patterns, and potential relationships between various customer attributes.

### Feature Engineering and Model Development:

To enhance the effectiveness of the customer segmentation process, the project incorporates the renowned RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. This model transforms raw customer data into meaningful features that capture crucial aspects of their banking behavior, such as the recency of their last transaction, the frequency of their transactions, and the total monetary value of their transactions.

Next, the project employs the K-means clustering algorithm, a widely used unsupervised learning technique for grouping similar data points into distinct clusters. To determine the optimal number of clusters for effective segmentation, the project utilizes the elbow method and silhouette score, both established evaluation metrics in the field of cluster analysis.

### Dimensionality Reduction and Classification:

While K-means clustering provides valuable insights into customer segmentation, the high dimensionality of the data can sometimes hinder the efficiency and interpretability of the model. To address this challenge, the project integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. PCA identifies and retains the most informative features from the data, allowing the clustering model to operate with a reduced feature set while preserving essential information for accurate cluster assignment.

Building upon the established customer clusters, the project further explores the potential of supervised learning for customer classification. The Naive Bayes algorithm is implemented on the clustered data, aiming to predict the cluster membership of new customers based on their characteristics. This classification model achieves an impressive F1 score of 98%, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately assigning new customers to their appropriate clusters.

### Interactive Web Application with Streamlit:

To facilitate real-time exploration and interaction with the customer segmentation model, the project leverages the user-friendly Streamlit framework. A web application is developed using Streamlit, enabling users to input new customer data and receive instant predictions regarding their corresponding customer cluster. This interactive interface empowers banks and analysts to gain valuable insights into the potential segment membership of new customers, informing targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer engagement initiatives.

### Conclusion and Future Enhancements:

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of K-means clustering and other data science techniques for effective customer segmentation within the banking domain. The project not only provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences but also paves the way for enhanced bank profitability through targeted customer engagement strategies.

Looking towards the future, the project can be further extended by exploring alternative clustering algorithms and evaluating their performance against K-means. Additionally, the integration of machine learning models for personalized product recommendations holds immense potential for further enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction. Finally, deploying the developed web application within a bank's operational environment would enable real-world utilization of the customer segmentation model, fostering data-driven decision-making and maximizing the project's impact on overall business objectives.
